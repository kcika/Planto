                <p>Plants bloom well and add a lush look and fresh feeling to our homes but many times, they may catch
                    infections in the
                    rainy season. Hence, during the rainy season, you need to provide equivalent efforts to beautify
                    your plants.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Beautiful, colourful plants like ferns, palm plants, or the Chlorophytum thrive and grow much better
                    than the flowering
                    plants in rains, the exception being lilies.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some plants like the ones listed below grow particularly well indoors during the monsoon and can be
                    bought online at
                    expert online plant nurseries like Root Bridges.</p>
                <br>
                <p>* <b>Anthurium plant</b> comes with large, heart-shaped glossy flower and leathery arrow-shaped green
                    leaves
                    and does not require
                    direct sunlight and hence grows very well during the monsoon.</p><br>
                <p>* <b>Green Fittonia Plant</b> which has delicate silvery-veined dark green leaves, is known to grow
                    well in
                    cool and moist
                    climate and hence an excellent choice of plant to grow during monsoons.</p><br>
                <p>* <b>Syngonium plant</b> has large five-lobed shaped pink-variegated dark green leaves. They bloom
                    well in humid climate and less
                    lit spaces and hence a good choice for monsoons.</p><br>
                <p>* <b>Monstera broken heart plant</b> also grows beautifully in the monsoon. The Broken Heart Plant,
                    sometimes
                    incorrectly
                    referred to as the Philodendron Broken Heart, is the smaller cousin of the large leaved Monstera
                    Deliciosa, and as
                    prized in the collection of every plant parent.</p><br>
                <p class="fs-24 fw-semibold">Best gardening tips in Monsoon:</p><br>
                <p>1. <b>Avoid water stagnation</b> - The accumulation of the rainwater in indoor plants located in the
                    balconies
                    or terraces of households is a major issue. It causes the soil nutrients to wash away and deprive
                    the plants of all the nourishment. Thus, make provision for drainage and see to it that all the
                    water moves out of the garden. For example, succulents receive a lot of watering than required
                    because of rainwater; hence, care should be taken to expose the plants to sunlight for a certain
                    period during the day and after the raining stops.</p><br>
                <p>2. <b>Prune regularly</b> - Prune your plant with pruning & cutting tools regularly and take off
                    the parts as soon as the rains
                    hit. This is the right time for new shoots to grow but space should be created for them.</p><br>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="../images/hero-blog2.1.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>3. <b>Allow usage of earthworms and other fertilizers</b> - Utilize earthworms and fertilizers during
                    the monsoon to ensure
                    that your soil never loses its fertility. Earthworms also keep the soil aerated and make sure that
                    the water percolates
                    below the surface. Use good organic slow releasing fertilizers and manures for your plant.</p><br>
                <p>4. <b>Avoid walking on the wet soil</b> - Avoid walking on wet soil, specifically where you intend to
                    plant
                    new saplings as
                    that can pack the soil particles together and squeeze out the necessary oxygen necessary for growth.
                </p><br>
                <p>5. <b>Make provision for light in your garden</b> - Light becomes an issue of worry during the
                    monsoons,
                    especially if you have
                    plants that are dependent on sunlight. Using artificial sources of light can be very effective
                    method to rid of
                    excessive monsoon insects. Allow some frogs or toads to enter your home plantations that help keep
                    your garden insect
                    free.</p><br>
                <p>6. <b>Pull out the weeds</b> - Weeds can grow rapidly during the rains and thus soak up the
                    nourishment
                    intended for your
                    plants. Hence, keep weeding in timely intervals to avoid harmful growth.</p><br>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="../images/hero-blog2.2.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>7. <b>Use perforated sheets to protect your plants from heavy rain</b> - Perforated sheets are
                    becoming more popular during
                    monsoon than the opaque sheets that hinder plant growth. They protect plants from excess rain while
                    still giving them
                    the necessary moisture.</p><br>
                <p>8. <b>Remove the algae</b> - Youâ€™ll need to get your hands dirty (or not, use gloves of course!) and
                    get rid
                    of the slimy algae
                    that begin to grow with the onset of the monsoon. Check your soil surface for the green algae
                    patches and remove them
                    immediately.</p><br>
                <p>9. <b>Prevent soil erosion</b> - Rainwater may cause soil erosion exposing roots which hamper the
                    growth of
                    plants. Create a
                    barrier around plants so that soil would not erode but remember this barrier should not create water
                    logging condition.</p><br>
                <p>10. <b>Provide physical support to your plants</b> - Many plants are vulnerable to strong wind so
                    make sure it is not damaging your plants. If you have some young slow growing trees or shrubs
                    planted in a garden, provide
                    physical support to them.</p><br>

                <p>We hope that these tips have shed some light on how to maintain your home garden during the monsoon.
                    Monsoon is a time
                    for growth and bloom exercising some necessary precautions. While the rain takes away the need to
                    water your plants
                    regularly, you still need to do your bit if you love your home garden.</p><br>
