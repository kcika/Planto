                <p>The changing weather makes everyone entail some adjustments; for instance, winters require warm
                    clothes, monsoon
                    requires umbrellas, and summers are more about keeping ourselves cool. Like us, our plants also need
                    a bit of tampering
                    in the care and attention they seek. Greenery adjusts well to the changing climates, but as loving
                    plant parents, we
                    must care for our green buddies in the best way possible so know about monsoon gardening tips</p>
                <br>
                <p>Every season demands specific changes in the treatment provided to the plant buddies. As winters call
                    for overwintering
                    plants, summers might ask for a bit of shelter; similarly, monsoon impacts the growth of the plants
                    in its own way. So,
                    here’s everything you will need to learn about monsoon gardening tips in India.</p>

                <p>Growing plants in rainy season is all about keeping plants healthy during rainy periods when the sun
                    is covered with
                    dewy clouds almost every day. Many factors vary for plants during the monsoon days due to
                    alterations in the temperature
                    outdoors, regular hydration, which can sometimes get overloaded, and pests who invite themselves to
                    seek moisture-laden
                    soils. But fret not, for we are here with the best rainy season plant care tips:</p><br>
                <p class="fs-20 fw-semibold">#1 Pre-monsoon Pruning</p><br>
                <p>Well, the actual care for plants starts way before the monsoon season knocks on our doors. This is
                    one of the most
                    underrated rainy season plant take care tips, but giving them a nice & clean trim session before the
                    upcoming monsoons
                    will make way for healthier growth during the rainy days. Removing dead & decayed growths will allow
                    the plant to
                    concentrate its energy on regeneration through smoother air circulation. Also, pruning is a
                    sure-shot method of
                    controlling the onslaught of fungal diseases in the greenery before the rains strike down.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="fs-20 fw-semibold">#2 Check Drainage</p><br>
                <p>Your plants’ monsoon care regime should ideally begin with checking the drainage holes in <b>floor
                        planters</b>. Firstly,
                    ensure each planter carries a bottom hole, as no matter the weather, without a clean drainage hole,
                    most of your plants
                    will rot and die. Further, check if the drainage holes require maintenance due to particles getting
                    stuck inside the
                    soil. One easy way to check this is by poking a stick inside the hole; if it goes in quickly, you
                    are good to go, but if
                    it doesn’t, remove the plant and change the soil. Also, ensure all planters are kept on <b>planter
                        trays</b>, allowing them to
                    drain faster while keeping the surface tidy.</p><br><br>
                <p class="fs-20 fw-semibold">#3 Soil Care</p><br>
                <p>Prepare a mix of <b>plant soil</b> with <b>garden manure</b>, mixing two parts of the former and one
                    of the
                    latter.
                    This enriching
                    potting mix will nourish your plants while keeping the soil well-drained at all times. Further,
                    check if all the pots
                    are filled up to half inches from the brim; if not, add more soil till the pot gets almost full.
                    Remember, you only wish
                    to leave about half inches at the top to let the water drain quicker instead of logging in the
                    container. This practice
                    will ensure water doesn’t reach empty spaces in the soil, as there will be no empty spaces for it to
                    reach. Moreover,
                    loosen the soil whenever possible, as it tends to get compacted due to continuous showers.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="fs-20 fw-semibold">#4 Monsoon Trimming</p><br>
                <p>Nature often overpours its love in the form of rains, which leads to thriving growth in some plants.
                    Such climates ask
                    us to be extra vigilant while trimming our plants during monsoons because it will no more just be
                    for grooming purposes.
                    During monsoons, it is better to cut the lower leaves so they don’t become a part of any waterlogged
                    situation. Also,
                    lower parts of the plants are more susceptible to fungal diseases during monsoons, so pruning them
                    well will take care
                    of any pesty predictions. Further, remove any damaged part so that it doesn’t catch an infection
                    which might later
                    spread to the whole plant.</p><br><br>

                <p class="fs-20 fw-semibold">#5 Use Disinfectants</p><br>
                <p>We all know that plant fungal infections are common during rainy days, so it is suggested to spray
                    disinfectants every
                    fifteen days during the rainy season. One may use natural fungicides like neem oil, hydrogen
                    peroxide, or some other
                    variant available in online gardening stores. Mix one tablespoon of fungicide in three liters of
                    water and apply it to
                    the plants with a <b>spray bottle</b>. Constant application of fungicides every fortnight will
                    ensure your
                    plants stay from
                    fungus, bacteria, and other germs.</p><br><br>
                <p class="fs-20 fw-semibold">#6 Insecticides & Pesticides</p><br>
                <p>Monsoon is the favorite season for those pests you never wish your plants to meet. Use
                    premium-quality insecticides and
                    natural pesticides for plants like neem oil every ten to fifteen days to let your plants live a
                    pest-free life. Mix
                    about five milliliters of good-quality insecticide in one liter of water and about three milliliters
                    of liquid soap.
                    Repeat this every fortnight to keep ybr
                    our greenery devoid of insects and further diseases. You can
                    also make the solution
                    once and store it for future uses.</p><br><br>

                <p class="fs-20 fw-semibold">#7 Feed Fertilizers</p><br>
                <p>Rain is often responsible for washing the topsoil away with heavy downpours, and the topsoil is as
                    crucial for plants as
                    measured watering, for it contains all the basic nutrients the plants need for thriving growth.
                    Whether you pick
                    chemical fertilizers or organic fertilizers, ensure the plants receive balanced doses of nitrogen,
                    potassium, and
                    phosphorous. Give them a balanced diet during the rainy season to ensure the soil doesn’t lack the
                    most critical
                    nutrients.</p><br><br>
                <p class="fs-14 fw-semibold">#8 Pot Shifting</p><br>
                <p>Although the sun seems a bit shy during the cloudy weather, whenever you can shift your hardy plants
                    like succulents &
                    cacti to a sunnier spot, please do. Also, ensure that hardy plants are not sitting directly under
                    the rainfall, as they
                    are the last beings on earth to like the rainy season. Other plants might like the monsoons more,
                    but they will succumb
                    to root rot or decayed growths if there’s too much rainwater in the containers, so try moving them
                    around whenever
                    possible. Also, clean the planter trays kept under the containers to keep a check on unnecessary
                    mosquito breeding.</p><br><br>
                <p class="fs-14 fw-semibold">#9 Watering Schedule</p><br>
                <p>Unlike summer and spring, the soil mostly stays moist during the rainy days. This is because the sun
                    is not that
                    intense, plus the plants receive ample water naturally. Although water is a crucial element when it
                    comes to growing a
                    garden, it is also important to understand that too much of anything is bad. While underwatering the
                    plants makes them
                    dull and droopy, overwatering causes the roots to rot internally. Keeping all this in mind, avoid
                    unnecessarily
                    hydrating your plants during rainy days. Only water when there have been no rains in the previous
                    days, and you see the
                    soil drier than before.

                <p>This is not an ongoing lecture, but we must mention the value of better understanding the plants to
                    grow a healthy
                    garden. Nature’s bountiful diversity allows us to grow greenery in all weathers; however, all plants
                    are different, and
                    they have different demands. For example, succulents & cacti are lovers of tropically heated
                    locations, so too much
                    rainfall will make them go crazy, and you will need to take care of them accordingly. On the other
                    hand, vegetables and
                    annuals need ample hydration to showcase their healthy yield. Do you see? The more you learn about
                    the plants in your
                    garden, the better you will care for them, irrespective of the changing seasons.</p><br><br>

                </div>
                <p>All of the above-mentioned tips for protecting plants from rain apply to indoor plants. Begin by
                    pruning them before the
                    first rain and checking the viability of the drainage holes. Never overwater the plants, no matter
                    the season, and
                    fertilize them, if needed. One point to consider separately for houseplants is to keep them on
                    brightly lit windowsills
                    that remain sheltered yet receive filtered sunshine. Also, clean the plant’s leaves regularly so
                    that sunlight
                    absorption stays on point.</p><br><br>
