            <p class="text-center"><em>-by</em> Elizabeth Waddington 14 June 2023</p>
            <div class="blog-content">
                <img src="../images/blog2.jpg" width="100%" alt="">
                <p>Studies have shown that houseplants improve productivity by 15% when added to an office environment.
                    The presence of
                    indoor plants can reduce stress, boost mood, and increase concentration levels, effectively
                    contributing to a more
                    efficient work environment. Simply adding houseplants can be a simple yet effective way to enhance
                    the overall
                    well-being and productivity of a workspace.</p><br>
                <p class="fs-24 fw-semibold">8 Reasons Indoor Plants Boost Your Productivity</p><br>
                <p class="fs-24 fw-semibold">1. Improve Mood</p><br>
                <p>A person’s mood is influenced by their surroundings. <b>Thoughts of nature reduce anger, fear, and
                        stress and increase mood
                        and well-being, creating happy employees who are motivated to be more productive</b>. The color
                    green is
                    known to be
                    calming, dark green in particular, but other colors have additional benefits. Green-yellow and
                    bright green create a
                    more exciting environment by adding brightness and a sense of strength.</p><br>
                <p class="fs-24 fw-semibold">2. Reduce Noise</p><br>
                <p><b>Rather than insulating against noise, plants absorb it, improving the working atmosphere by
                        allowing
                        people to focus more</b>. People concentrate better when it’s quiet, and plants can help create
                    that
                    more peaceful
                    environment. Rather than
                    resorting to noise-canceling headphones, consider adding plants to the home or office environment.
                    Putting them on the
                    outskirts of the work area helps neutralize noise that would otherwise interfere with getting
                    anything done.</p><br>
                <p class="fs-24 fw-semibold">3. Help Reconnect with Nature</p><br>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="../images/blog2.1.avif" width="480" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>Biophilia is a human’s innate desire to be a part of nature. Putting people indoors, particularly in
                    offices, robs them
                    of this need. <b>Adding plants to an indoor environment helps people reconnect to nature,
                        significantly boosting productivity by decreasing stress and anxiety levels</b>. These levels
                    naturally increase when people are put in indoor-only
                    environments without access to plants.</p><br>
                <p class="fs-24 fw-semibold">4. Clean the Air</p><br>
                <p>he air inside a building is less healthy than outside, even in busy urban areas. <b>The
                        photosynthesis
                        process produced by
                        plants reduces the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an indoor environment, increasing oxygen
                        and
                        reducing carbon
                        dioxide, staving off headaches and fatigue and making it easier to concentrate</b>. They can
                    even cancel out chemicals like formaldehyde and benzene, often released by office equipment and
                    furniture.</p><br>
                <p class="fs-24 fw-semibold">5. Stimulate Creativity</p><br>
                <p><b>Studies have shown that looking at nature can stimulate creativity, inspiring the brain to operate
                        more effectively and
                        improve productivity</b>. Even just looking at pictures of nature can improve a person’s
                    creative
                    output. Additional studies
                    explain a phenomenon known as “the green effect,” which is employees’ increased creativity after
                    looking at the color
                    green for as little as two seconds. It is suggested that looking at the color green inspires people
                    to grow, like a
                    plant. Greenery also increases memory and attention span by up to 20%.</p><br>
                <p class="fs-24 fw-semibold">6. Regulate Humidity</p><br>
                <p><b>Dry air in a home or office can lead to nosebleeds, sinusitis, asthma, and bronchitis, all of
                        which
                        lead to sluggishness
                        and impair productivity, but which can be improved by adding houseplants</b>. Plants create
                    moisture
                    through a process known
                    as evapotranspiration, pulling water from the soil to keep themselves hydrated and dispersing the
                    remainder in the
                    surrounding air, regulating humidity in an office environment. Dry air can also lead to skin or eye
                    irritation, slowing
                    productivity, but adding houseplants can help return the humidity in the house or office to normal
                    levels.</p><br>
                <p class="fs-24 fw-semibold">7. Improve Concentration</p><br>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="../images/blog2.2.avif" width="480" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>Carbon dioxide is high in indoor environments, but plants release oxygen that can help balance the
                    levels in the air,
                    improving a person’s ability to concentrate. <b>Short of taking breaks and going outside, nothing is
                        as
                        effective at
                        clearing a person’s mind and improving concentration as adding houseplants, and that clarity
                        aids in
                        worker
                        productivity</b>.</p><br>
                <p>The need to improve concentration is greater than ever with today’s workforce. Extended hours spent
                    in front of a screen
                    reduce concentration exponentially over time. Adding houseplants to the environment breaks up the
                    monotony and helps
                    return focus to the work at hand.</p><br>
                <p class="fs-24 fw-semibold">8. Reduce Stress</p><br>
                <p>Studies have shown that people who spend time in nature are less stressed, but Americans spend 90% of
                    their time
                    indoors. Adding houseplants to a home or office is like spending time outdoors, reducing stress
                    levels and allowing
                    workers to be more productive by reducing the friction in their lives. The color green is calming,
                    and some flowering
                    plants are aromatherapeutic.</p><br>
                <p>Cortisol production is also reduced when people spend time around plants. The stress hormone is
                    housed in saliva, and
                    its production is reduced when people are around greenery. Studies found that caring for plants also
                    reduced both
                    psychological and physiological stress. Interacting with greenery suppresses sympathetic nervous
                    system activity and
                    lowers blood pressure.</p><br>
